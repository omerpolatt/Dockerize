# Dockerize

Docker is a platform that runs applications in isolated containers, allowing you to quickly develop projects without touching their code and without dealing with complex setups.


Dockerfile: A text file that defines how to create a Docker image. It specifies the contents of the image, its dependencies and how to run it.

Docker Images:  Ready-made templates that contain all the environment and dependencies needed to run the project. These images contain the application's code, runtime, libraries and other dependencies. 

Docker Container: A running instance of a Docker image. Images are run as containers and each has its own isolated working environment.

Docker Hub: The official Docker platform where Docker images are stored and shared. It provides a large image repository and community support.

# RUN  

To run docker, we have prepared ready-made codes for you, just run it with  __bash run.sh__ in your terminal. 

# Warning
I have edited the docker usage codes and put them into our docker.txt file
